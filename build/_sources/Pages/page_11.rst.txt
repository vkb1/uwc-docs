**Steps for converting to LFM**

Use files from **0502_1500m.zip** folder

1.	Create a FAT32 file-system on a USB stick, then dump each BIOS file structure to the root as needed.
2.	Prepare the LFM BIOS first on USB, then boot to the USB’s EFI device (boot priorities).
3.	After setting the Boot priorities save & exit from boot menu. You will be switched to Command window. Press any key to enter to command line, type flash.nsh to update the BIOS.
4.	Restart the HW and you will now be locked at 1750MHz
5.	Check frequency of device using command *$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep “MHz”*

**Steps for reverting to normal Frequency**

Use files from **A.103** folder

1.	Create a FAT32 file-system on a USB stick, then dump each BIOS file structure to the root as needed.
2.	Prepare the LFM BIOS first on USB, then boot to the USB’s EFI device (boot priorities).
3.	After setting the Boot priorities save & exit from boot menu. You will be switched to Command window. Press any key to enter to command line, type flash.nsh to update the BIOS.
